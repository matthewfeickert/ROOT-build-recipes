# ROOT build recipes

Recipes for building releases of ROOT against Python 3 with pyenv

Building ROOT is one of the most frustrating and time consuming things I have to do on occasion.
I have [more experience with it than most people in HEP](https://gitlab.cern.ch/atlas-amglab/atlstats), but I still find it to be a process that can easily take hours of an evening to debug.
These recipes should be viewed as case studies of from source builds in a realistic end user environment that actually worked.
